A very badly written, probably insecure, functionally limited slackbot. Hacked
together to download scenes generated by WordsEye. Also supports the reversing
of gifs, and the rewinding of gifs (first played normally, then reversed).

Used like this:

`/show a horse standing on a bike`

to generate that scene (via WordsEye API) and return to the channel.

Used like this:

`/show add potato http://oregonaitc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/potato.jpg`

to make `/show potato` show a potato rather than a WordsEye scene. In the case
that there are multiple definitions for potato, a random image will be chosen
with each request.

`/show reversed https://media.giphy.com/media/HhTXt43pk1I1W/giphy.gif`

will download the GIF at the given URL, reverse it (using gifsicle), store it,
and return a publicly accessible URL.

`/show rewound https://media.giphy.com/media/HhTXt43pk1I1W/giphy.gif`

will do the same as the above, but with the gif first being replayed in the
normal order, before being played in reverse.


You'll need flask, and requests installed, and require "gifsicle" to be on your
$PATH. You'll also need to modify main.py to specify you gif url, gif dir and
WordsEye cookie.

If this is going to become a real thing, it probably needs re-writing, as it's
currently a cobbled together mess.
